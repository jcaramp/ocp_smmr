ocp_smmr
=========

This role implements tasks for add or delete a project as member in the Service Mesh Member Roll in Openshift, to be managed by Service Mesh.

Also, it is **idempotent**, because if you try to add a role that is yet a member of Service Mesh Member Roll, the role will not perform any action. And the same to delete action.
